### <a id="what-is-næg"></a>What is Næg?

Næg is an app that helps you get others to do what they should do.   
How do you do that? You add `Task`s to `People` in a `Room`. What sets Næg apart from other task managing apps is the ability to set a `Næg frequency` for each task. This means you can nag people to do their tasks with varying intensity, from a gentle reminder to an all-out bombardment of notifications. 

### <a id="how-to-add-tasks-to-people-in-a-room"></a>How to add tasks to people in a room

Begin by adding a  

-  __Room__  
The space is the arena you want tasks done in. You want one space for `Home` and one for `School`? You add two `Room`s. This is so you don't næg your colleagues to take out the trash at  your place.


- __People__  
The people are the persons you want to do the `Task`s you add. While making tasks you assign those tasks to specific people. You invite people to your `Room` by using the `Sidebar` and choose whether to send them a mail with a link, or an SMS with a link.


- __Tasks__  
The tasks are done by the People added to a Room. You add a `task` by clicking the `+` button in the lower right corner or by using the `Sidebar`. This is also where you will set the [næg frequency](#næg-frequency).

### Næg frequency
#### Low
- This notifies the assigned persons to do the task with typical intensity, much like a notification on Snapchat and Messenger.
#### Medium
- This notifies the assigned persons to do the task with medium intensity. Repeated notifications.
#### Næg special
- This is what sets Næg apart from other productivity apps. The assigned persons will get a personalized exponentially increasing notification regime. Use sparingly for most people, but feel free to torment lazy roommates not adhering to the rental contract.
#### Custom
- You can also customize the frequency of notifications, or choose not to notify users at all within certain timeframes. Great for those who work night shifts or to adjust for personal differing schedules.
