### How to add tasks to people in a space

Begin by adding a  

- __Space__  
The space is the arena you want tasks done in. You want one space for `Home` and one for `School`? You add two spaces. This is so you don't næg your colleagues to take out the trash at  your place.


- __People__  
The people are the persons you want to do the tasks you add. While making tasks you assign those tasks to specific people. You invite people to your space by using the sidebar and choose whether to send them a mail with a link, or an SMS with a link.


- __Tasks__  
The tasks are done by the people in a space. You add a task by clicking the `+` button in the lower right corner or by using the sidebar. This is also where you will set the [næg frequency]().
